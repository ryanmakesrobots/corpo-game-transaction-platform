<h1>Corpo Game (scenario)</h1>
Corpo Game is a fictional online fantasy game that allows users to trade corpo-coins in exchange for items, to support one-another or as 'looser-tokens' due to failure in battle.
Users can load their accounts with corpo-coins from the online portal, which requires a payment method. Once loaded, users can spend their coins how they choose.

Here is the code for a distributed, microservice payment platform that seeks to utilise a cloud-native Azure approach.
